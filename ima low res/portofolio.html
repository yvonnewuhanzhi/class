    <h1>My inspiration</h1>
    <p>I usually have the habit of listening to light music, and one of my favorite pieces of music is the background music in this project. There is a slight sound of fireflies in this music and the overall rhythm is very calm. So whenever I'm stressed I listen to this music and it makes me feel calm and meditative.

        One day, while I was listening to this music and scrolling through xiaohongshu for inspiration for my final project, I came across this simple illustration—Dreamy purple woods with cute little deer.It gave me INSPIRATION to think that I can build a forest of my own.</p>
    <h1>My idea</h1>
    <p>I was planning to make an interactive toy for children—mystic grove. For this final project I combined Arduino and p5 to create a small forest.</p>
    <p>This is a mysterious black cardboard box, when the child holds a flashlight and shines it on all corners of the cardboard box, it will trigger some interactive organs in the forest, for example, the owl's eyes glow (the LEDs light up), the deer by the creek lifts its head(with servo motors), and the stars sparkling in the background. They are all connected to the p5js to make the sound of the grass,stars, and the following animation.</p>
    <p>For the Arduino part, I will be using 3 photoresistors, three photoresistors will trigger three interactive effects inside the cardboard box. Five white LEDs light up to represent stars twinkling, two yellow LEDs light up to represent an owl's eyes glowing, and the rotation of a servomotor prompts the deer's head to rotate.<br> For the P5 part, I added the background light music. In the initial state, there are fireflies flashing on the screen.When the flashlight finds the three photoresistors of the arduino, p5 will have the effects of a deer appearing, a star blinking, and a falling leaf on the screen, which use the functions of picture, random, and class, respectively.</p>
